# List---Lego-Stack
Given a row of Lego Blocks consisting of n blocks. All the blocks given have a square base whose side length is known. We need to stack the blocks over each other and create a vertical tower. Block-1 can go over Block-2 only if sideLength(Block-2)>=sideLength(Block-1).  From the row (list) of Lego blocks, one can only pick up either the leftmost or rightmost block. Print "Possible" if it is possible to stack all n cubes this way or else print "Impossible".
